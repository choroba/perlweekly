      "Hi",
      "Two weeks ago I asked <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/594\">How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs?</a> and I received quite a few nice comments. Thank you! I'll have another question today.",
      "Yesterday I asked in a Web 3 group how to <a href=\"https://web3.code-maven.com/\">get started with Web3, Blockchain, cryptocurrency, Ethereum</a>.... I got a few suggestions including a link to the <a href=\"https://roadmap.sh/blockchain\">Blockchain Roadmap</a>. So I checked. There is also a <a href=\"https://roadmap.sh/python\">Python Roadmap</a> and a <a href=\"https://roadmap.sh/rust\">Rust roadmap</a>, but I have not found a <b>Perl Roadmap</b>. Not even a community created one. IMHO, if you are interested in making Perl easier to learn, more available and hopefully more popular than you might want to invest some time to create a community roadmap for Perl and maybe even to get it listed as an official roadmap.",
      "Which brings me to my question this week <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/601\">What could be done to make Perl more popular?</a>. I'd appreciate your comments there.",
      "On a totally different subject. I think this might be a good time to mention that if you find my work valuable to you, I'd appreciate if you could also express it by sponsoring me. GitHub provides a way to make it very easy to give 5-10-20 USD / month to express your gratitude and help me invest more time in the public work.
