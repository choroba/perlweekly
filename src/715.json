      "Hi there!",
      "Two weeks ago I asked <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/713.html\">Why do companies migrate away from Perl?</a> and got a lot of responses. Most of them described the reasons their employers decided on this change but a few also wrote why they stay using Perl. Some of the answers were only a few lines, some were longer, going into a lot more details. I think I managed to reply to every one, though to some people I replied only today as I went over the messages again. I think it would be interesting o publish the full responses, but that's up to the respective people. Let me know if you do so I can mention your post in the newsletter.",
      "I collected the most common responses and put them on my web site: <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/why-move-away-from-perl-by-readers-of-the-perl-weekly\">Why move away from Perl? From the readers of the Perl Weekly</a>.",
      "The most important reason was the lack of available Perl developers (both senior and junior) and the lack of willingness to learn Perl. (coolness, availability of jobs)",
      "The second reason was the lack of 3rd party libraries and the quality of the existing ones.",
      "None of these complaints are new. They just got worse in the last decade or so as number of people using Perl was shrinking.",
      "The question is, what do we do about this? Some people keep working towards improving <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/\">Perl</a>, <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/recent\">CPAN</a> and the whole <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">ecosystem</a>. I still run this newsletter, despite the fact that I have no income from Perl and maybe I should invest my time in other hobbies.",
      "What I see is that I can help Perl developers and companies using Perl to evaluate what would be the cost/benefit ratio staying with Perl or switching to some other language. I personally use <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/\">Rust and Python</a>, though from the responses I saw that others switch to NodeJS and/or to Go.",
      "So that's where we are at. If you would like to extend the useful life of Perl there are plenty of things you can do and I'd be happy to read about them and share them in the newsletter. If you are interested in moving to some other language, you can talk to me. I might be able to help.",
