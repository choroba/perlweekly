      "One of the best things about programming is that you can get almost immediate feedback from your work. The compiler tells you immediately if your code has syntax errors. Your tests can tell you within minutes if your code does what you expected on your computer. Your CI system can tell you within another few minutes if your code works on various other environments.",
      "In the Perl community writing test became the norm. You rarely find any Open Source Perl code without tests. People write test even for code that only they use. Even for code they consider 'toys'. Yet with CI we are still far from it. On our <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html\">stats page</a> you can see that 12% are missing their link to VCS (some of those do have VCS they are just missing the link), but 45-60% (depending on the week) of CPAN releases have no CI configured.",
