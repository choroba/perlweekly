      "Hi there,",
      "Few days ago, I came across the <a href=\"https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/announcements\">official announcement</a> with regard to the name change. I saw mixed reaction on Facebook groups for <strong>Perl</strong> fans.",
      "<strong>So what is my (personal) view on the topic?</strong>",
      "I understand name change is not an easy decision, it must have been going on for days if not months. My view is to keep <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> separate. Having said, I like the name change at least it is better than what it was before. Since we are talking about name change, my suggestion is why not change it back to <strong>\"Yet Another Society (YAS)\"</strong> as it was before if I am not mistaken. Then have two separate board under its wings i.e. <strong>\"The Perl Foundation (TPF)\"</strong> and <strong>\"The Raku Foundation (TRF)\"</strong>. Also allow the individual board to decide the path they want to follow. This way we don't cross each others path and stay friendly. It sounds simple, isn't it? Not sure if it is easy to implement.",
      "This name change brought back memories when I decided to change the name <strong>Perl Weekly Challenge</strong>. As you all know, right from day one, we decided to have both <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong> as the main contributing languages. A few months later after the launch, I found the name not reflecting what actual happens on the ground. But I already had the domain <strong>perlweeklychallenge.org</strong> registered and all the actions were happening under the same domain. After discussing with some of my close friends, I decided to change it to a new domain, <strong>theweeklychallenge.org</strong>. To me, it makes more sense as we gradually opened up to many more languages, <strong>92</strong> to be precise as of today. It wasn't an easy decision for me to change the name and move everything to new domain. <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> helped me with the domain switch and patch the old domain to divert trafic to the new domain. Everthing seems to be stable now but I still refer the team as <strong>Team PWC</strong> as it is very close to my heart.",
      "<strong>How was your experience with Hacktoberfest 2022?</strong>",
      "My contributions this time didn't meet the minimum requirement of the event. Although I submitted <strong>4 Pull Requests</strong> and all of them were accepted and merged by the author but only <strong>2 PR</strong> were counted as the other two PR were part of non-participating repositories. Having said, I am happy many of the <strong>Team PWC</strong> members got more than <strong>4 Pull Requests</strong> this time. Congratulations <strong>Team PWC</strong>.",
