Thanks to the Pull-Request of Dave Cross the link was removed from our web site within a few hours. The strange thing is that the post is still up on Medium. I would have thought they would want to avoid having scams on their website.",

The back-end is indeed hard to setup, but I think the front-end is quite easy and that part is also written in Perl. I have a bunch of posts, some of them videos about <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/metacpan\">MetaCPAN</a>, including direction, how to contribute to it. I think it is also a very good feeling once your contribution is accepted and it goes live on the site.
