He has been running <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com\">Perl Maven</a> for years now and many of us benefitted from his work. He recently started blogging on <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab\">Dev.To</a>. I request all the <strong>Perl</strong> fans to follow him and like blog post. I didn't have the account there before so I decided to create <a href=\"https://dev.to/manwar\">personal account</a>. Although I no longer blog at all but this is going to change soon. Earlier I used to blog on <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar\">blogs.perl.org</a> but then I moved to <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs\">The Weekly Challenge</a> recently.",
