      "Hi there!",
      "Ramadan seems to have a very positive impact on <a href=\"https://manwar.org/\">Mohammad Sajid Anwar (manwar)</a>, author of <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">The Weekly Challenge</a> and co-editor of <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/\">The Perl Weekly newsletter</a>. He learns all kinds of new things and writes long blog posts about them. Some of them are Perl related, some are not. Anyway, see the links in this newsletter.",
      "I, on the other hand, was recently contacted by a number of people wanting to migrate from Perl to Rust or Python. My first question is <b>why</b>. After all even if I end up helping them with the move, I need to understand why do they want to move. Because of this I started to have some picture of why people feel the urge to move away from Perl. However, my sample is too small and probably rather biased.  None of the people who contacted me wanted to move to Java or C, or NodeJS. That's can be for many reasons, one of them the fact that I don't mention those languages on my LinkedIn profile.",
      "So I'd like to get your help in understanding the central motivations for wanting to move away from Perl. If your company has moved away or is discussing the idea, I'd love to hear from you (a private email would be excellent) to understand the real pain points.",
      "On the other hand, if your company has recently moved to Perl or is planning to do so, I'd love to hear about that too. If they need help I'd be glad to <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/moving-between-perl-python-rust\">help them too</a> and I am sure people in the Perl community would be thrilled to hear such stories. Even if we can't publish the names of the companies.",
      "Enjoy your week!"
