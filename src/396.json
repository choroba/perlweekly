      "Last week, Gabor Szabo, the Chief Editor of PerlWeekly newsletter started the campaign to involve readers and asked what they want to read in the future newsletter. Taking a clue from it, I came up with the idea of \"Perl Weekly Challenge\". I am certain this is not the first time anyone tried it. Still I want to revive it primarily to engage the Perl enthusiasts. It can be Perl5 or Perl6. My first target is to setup a team who are interested in the weekly challenge. Then we will throw some random challenge to public and see how many different results we get back. We can then pick one as winner, put it on \"Hall of Fame\". We could encourage the winner to share the answer to the challenge as a small blog.",
