Every time a new module or a new version of an older module is uploaded to CPAN (via <a href=\"https://pause.perl.org/\">PAUSE</a>) within days and sometimes even within hours the CPAN Testers would download the new release, test it on their machines, and send a report to the author. Sometimes they would even open issues/tickets manually to report the problem and help the author(s) fix them.",
      "These days, however, Open Source developers can use a number of free Continuous Integration systems that would give them feedback much sooner: On every push to GitHub or GitLab. They can run the author or release tests on these systems. They can configure to test other modules that use their module (reverse dependencies) to make sure the new changes don't have a negative impact on these users. They can can even re-run all the tests every day making sure that changes in the dependencies of the module don't break it. (CPAN Testers usually run the tests of a module only if you release a new version or if your module is a dependency of something that was released.)",
      "By catching certain issues before they release a new version they provide a better experience to every user of CPAN and they also take some of the manual work off the shoulders of the CPAN Testers who are few.",
      "For many years Travis-CI was the de-facto standard to set up CI for GitHub-based project. These days it is primarily GitHub Actions.",
      "So, I have been on a quest to configure GitHub Actions to all the Perl projects where the author is interested. I have <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/os\">documented some of these</a> and I have written on <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/ci\">Why and how to CI</a>. I use the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/\">CPAN Digger</a> to locate candidates, but if you'd like to get help with setting up CI, open an issue on your project and tag <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/\">me</a>. If you like my quest, feel free to <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/support.html\">sponsor me</a> so I'll be able to allocate more time to this. Oh, and if your company needs help with CI and test automation, I offer that as a service.",
