<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today marks the start of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, taking place in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Munich&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May 12-14, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This three-day event promises to be packed with insightful sessions. You can checkout the schedules for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-12&#x22;&#x3E;Day 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-13&#x22;&#x3E;Day 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-14&#x22;&#x3E;Day 3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed several familiar names from the recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, including &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Salve J. Nilsen&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ference Erki&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There are also regular attendees like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Overmeer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Nicholas Clark&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Max Maischein&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Renee Backer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Soren Laird Sorries&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. However, one notable absence is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thomas Klausner&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Looking at the schedule, it&#x27;s shaping up to be a highly impactful event. And yes, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;R Geoffrey Avery&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the Gong man, is also listed as the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lightning Talks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; manager.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As many of you know the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, wrapped up just a week ago and we&#x27;ve already seen plenty of event reports from the participants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This was my first time attending the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, and I&#x27;m grateful to the organisers for the opportunity. While I&#x27;ve been to many &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conferences&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was a completely different experience altogether. The setting allowed for more frequent interaction with attendees, making it easier to seek (and receive) instant help. The knowledge sharing was at its peak, especially with people like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the room. Some participants like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leo Lapworth&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; joined remotely via video conference.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wasn&#x27;t fully prepared as my invitation came at the last minute. In contrast, most attendees had everything well planned. I observed structured groups focusing on specific tasks e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Security&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was free to join any. I chose &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; both because it&#x27;s close to my heart and because of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t have my laptop set up for contributions initially. But thanks to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; environment, I had a working local &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; web instance, in no time. You can read more about my experience in my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/pts-2025&#x22;&#x3E;detailed event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Other attendees like &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-participation-to-the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025-41j2&#x22;&#x3E;Thibault Duponchelle&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2025/05/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025.html&#x22;&#x3E;Paul Johnson&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlpunk.github.io/posts/2025-05-the-annual-perl-toolchain-summit-2025&#x22;&#x3E;Tina Muller&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2025/05/a-different-perl-toolchain-summit.html&#x22;&#x3E;Leon Timmermans&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, also shared their insights.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#719 - How do you deal with the decline?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/719.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is no secret that there are less and less jobs that are for &#x27;Perl developers&#x27;. I still see many &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=perl&#x22;&#x3E;job posts that mention Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but those are mostly cases where Perl is just one of the items in a large toolbox. In many cases you can still use Perl as a tool. There is less and less demand for perl application developers. There is 0 demand for teaching Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I encountered this many years ago and first learned &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Python and now Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E; because that&#x27;s what my clients ask for. How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs? I&#x27;d love to get your feedback and for that I open an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/594&#x22;&#x3E;issue&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in the GitHub repository of the Perl Weekly. I&#x27;d love to read what you do!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Perl-related events:&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the bottom of each issue we include a list of Perl-related events. They can also be seen on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and you can even use our ical file to see the events in your calendar application.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This information is collected in a JSON file in our repository. The file is linked at the top of that page. If you organize a Perl-related event or if you know about one that is not listed there, send us a Pull-Request and we can include it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#718 - Top Perl Companies</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/718.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please accept my apology for sharing a crypto scam link in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;716th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the newsletter. Thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it was removed straight away. I will be more cautious from now onwards, promise.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently, I stumbled upon a post titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Top 11 Perl Services Companies in the World in 2025&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Sadly, not a single one is based in my city &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was a time, we had plenty! Still, it&#x27;s not all bad. I was thrilled to see &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ActiveState&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on the list, the company behind &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ActiveState Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/716.html&#x22;&#x3E;earlier edition of the newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I mentioned my wish to attend the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; which is an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;invite-only&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; annual event. I also shared my interest in contributing to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; project. To my absolute delight, that wish came true the very same day! I received an invitation from the organiser to join the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, happening in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leipzig, Germany&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from May 1st to May 4th 2025. I didn&#x27;t wait even a second to accept the invitation. It&#x27;s truly an honour to be part of such a talented group.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In all the excitement, I&#x27;ve already booked my flight ticket to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Berlin&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and from there I&#x27;ll hop on a fast train to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leipzig&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The last time, I visited Germany was back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; when I attended the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the city of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gummersbach&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I even gave couple of talks and one of them being &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Introduction to Map::Tube&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. After the event, I even shared my experience in this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#717 - Happy Easter</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/717.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First of all I need to apologize. Last week we mistakenly included a link to a crypto scam. Clearly we have to be more careful with our inclusion policy. Thanks to the Pull-Request of Dave Cross the link was removed from our web site within a few hours. The strange thing is that the post is still up on Medium. I would have thought they would want to avoid having scams on their website.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week Mohammad wrote that he keeps planning to be involved in the MetaCPAN project. As far as I remember it has two major part written in Perl. The back-end is indeed hard to setup, but I think the front-end is quite easy and that part is also written in Perl. I have a bunch of posts, some of them videos about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/metacpan&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, including direction, how to contribute to it. I think it is also a very good feeling once your contribution is accepted and it goes live on the site. Besides, you get on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/about/contributors&#x22;&#x3E;list of contributors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#716 - CVE in Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/716.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A few days ago, I wrote a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/cve-in-perl&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVEs&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was my first time looking at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVEs&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; closely. Then I came across a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1jy9pbe/perl_5402_and_5384_released_with_cve_fix&#x22;&#x3E;reddit post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; discussing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVE-2024-56406&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am a bit confused, was this fixed in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/5.38.4/perldelta&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.38.4&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5402delta&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.40.2&#x3C;/a&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;That said, it gave me something fun to dig into. I already know what I&#x27;ll be doing next. During my search, I discovered the, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://security.metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Security Group&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a community effort dedicated to handling security incidents on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Pretty cool!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Also the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; needs our support as mentioned in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025-needs-you&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m happy to see my current employer, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, listed as one of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;In-Kind Sponsors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Now, I&#x27;m curious to find out who the lucky team member is that gets to attend!. It&#x27;s happening this year from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thursday May 1st&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sunday May 4th 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the summit was held so close to me, in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Marlow&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, if I recall correctly. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again, I have to get involved in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; project. The main blocker last time was setting up the local development environment. I spoke to someone about it, can&#x27;t remember who, and he mentioned the team was working on simplifying the setup process to make it easier for contributors. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check the current status, but I&#x27;m adding it to my ever-growing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TODO&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; list.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Monday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and enjoy the rest of the newsletter!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#715 - Why do companies move away from Perl?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/715.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I asked &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/713.html&#x22;&#x3E;Why do companies migrate away from Perl?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and got a lot of responses. Most of them described the reasons their employers decided on this change but a few also wrote why they stay using Perl. Some of the answers were only a few lines, some were longer, going into a lot more details. I think I managed to reply to every one, though to some people I replied only today as I went over the messages again. I think it would be interesting o publish the full responses, but that&#x27;s up to the respective people. Let me know if you do so I can mention your post in the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I collected the most common responses and put them on my web site: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/why-move-away-from-perl-by-readers-of-the-perl-weekly&#x22;&#x3E;Why move away from Perl? From the readers of the Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The most frequently mentioned reason was the lack of available Perl developers (both senior and junior) and the lack of willingness to learn Perl. (coolness, few opportunities to reuse the knowladge)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The second reason was the lack of 3rd party libraries and the quality of the existing ones. Long-standing bugs, lots of open issues without a new release, etc.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;None of these complaints are new. They just got worse in the last decade or so as the number of people using Perl was shrinking.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The question is, what do we do about this? Some people keep working towards improving &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/recent&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the whole &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;ecosystem&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I still run this newsletter, despite the fact that I have no income from Perl and maybe I should invest my time in other hobbies.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What I see is that I can help Perl developers and companies using Perl to evaluate what would be the cost/benefit ratio staying with Perl or switching to some other language. I personally use &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Rust and Python&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, though from the responses I saw that others switch to NodeJS and/or to Go.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So that&#x27;s where we are at. If you would like to extend the useful life of Perl there are plenty of things you can do and I&#x27;d be happy to read about them and share them in the newsletter. If you are interested in moving to some other language, you can talk to me. I might be able to help with that.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#714 - Munging Data?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/714.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Idd&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to all the weekly newsletter readers who celebrate the festival. We celebrated Idd yesterday in England and I assume it is being celebrated today in my native country, India.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me personally, the highlight of last week was the event organised by the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It focussed on the new edition of the book, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/datamungingwithperl&#x22;&#x3E;Data Munging With Perl (2nd edition)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Unfortunately I missed the event despite registering for it. However, I&#x27;m told the recording will be available soon. If you missed it too, don&#x27;t worry, you will be able to catch up soon.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of the book, it is one of those must read classics for every &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programmers. I read it, when it was first released, and I highly recommend you getting a copy to benefit from it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; mentioned &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; seemed to have had positive impact on me as I started writing more frequently these days. He was absolutely right!. But now that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is over, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue at the same pace. That said, I truly enjoyed this little burst of writing. It felt like therapy to me. It allowed me to share whatever was on my mind at the time. And when I receive encouraging responses, it gives me even more motivation to keep going.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wrote few pieces last week, all of which are listed below. Please do check them out and share your thoughts.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;d also like to take this opportunity to thank, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for his incredible book: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl_new_features&#x22;&#x3E;Perl New Features&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have shared my take on some of the topics discussed in the book, and I highly recommend getting a copy. The latest edition has been updated to cover &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This edition of the newsletter is packed with positive &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; news, so take your time and enjoy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Happy Monday!!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#713 - Why do companies migrate away from Perl?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/713.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ramadan seems to have a very positive impact on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://manwar.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammad Sajid Anwar (manwar)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, author of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and co-editor of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. He learns all kinds of new things and writes long blog posts about them. Some of them are Perl related, some are not. Anyway, see the links in this newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I, on the other hand, was recently contacted by a number of people wanting to migrate from Perl to Rust or Python. My first question is &#x3C;b&#x3E;why&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. After all even if I end up helping them with the move, I need to understand why do they want to move. Because of this I started to have some picture of why people feel the urge to move away from Perl. However, my sample is too small and probably rather biased.  None of the people who contacted me wanted to move to Java or C, or NodeJS. That&#x27;s can be for many reasons, one of them the fact that I don&#x27;t mention those languages on my LinkedIn profile.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I&#x27;d like to get your help in understanding the central motivations for wanting to move away from Perl. If your company has moved away or is discussing the idea, I&#x27;d love to hear from you (a private email would be excellent) to understand the real pain points.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the other hand, if your company has recently moved to Perl or is planning to do so, I&#x27;d love to hear about that too. If they need help I&#x27;d be glad to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/moving-between-perl-python-rust&#x22;&#x3E;help them too&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I am sure people in the Perl community would be thrilled to hear such stories. Even if we can&#x27;t publish the names of the companies.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#712 - RIP Zefram</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/712.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We lost, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Zefram&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a very respectable and prolific contributor to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core. The sad news was shared on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2025/03/msg269672.html&#x22;&#x3E;P5P&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. He was a regular attendee of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Although I never interacted with him personally,  I always followed his contributions on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/author/ZEFRAM&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I also found his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.fysh.org/~zefram&#x22;&#x3E;web space&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where his works are nicely logged. Additionally, there is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZBYRT5Ghc&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of him presenting at the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop 2015&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is happening from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May 1 to May 4, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Hosting such event is only possible because of the generous sponsors, as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2025/sponsors.html&#x22;&#x3E;listed here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Speaking of sponsors, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Deriv&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is one name you&#x27;ll find at most &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; gatherings. There is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/why-deriv-supports-the-perl-ecosystem&#x22;&#x3E;dedicated post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that details why? I remember when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Booking.com&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; used to be everywhere and was often the first to sponsor. Finding a sponsor in current environment is really tough, all credit goes to the team working tirelessly behind the scenes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have a firsthand experience in seeking sponsors for my pet project: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I was lucky enough to find our first sponsor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Careers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; (by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pete Sergeant&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;) without much effort. After a long term sponsorship, he stopped it about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ago. Fortunately, we immediately found another generous sponsor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who has been our solo sponsor ever since. In both cases, I didn&#x27;t actively seek out sponsors, they found us. The main obstacle we face is that we are not a registered organisation. It remains a one-man organisation, and I lack the experience to run a registered organisation entity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; continues, today marks &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 17 of Ramadan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and I find my routine slightly disrupted. Not that I am complaining, it is just that my sleep pattern has changed. I don&#x27;t need to emphasize, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;How important is sleep.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; I have learned that the hard way. However, there is a positive side to this change in routine. It has given me time to re-visit my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TODO&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; list. There was a time when I used to blog regularly but then I stopped completely. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed but I&#x27;ve started writing again. Below are some of my recent posts, in case you missed any.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is still a lot in the pipeline. I hope to share it soon. So far, I have received positive feedbacks which has given me the energy to continue. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your kind words.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I should pause here and give you time to go through rest of the newsletter. Enjoy and please take a good care of your physical and mental health.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#711 - Obfuscating Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/711.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might know I used to teach Perl and helped companies using Perl. Unfortunately, in the last couple of years only a few companies asked for my help with Perl and in most cases in areas I am not that familiar with. So I referred them to other, well known consultants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Instead of Perl most of my clients are asking for help with Python and Rust. Especially because of the latter I felt the need to know more about C and C++. At least to the level where I understand the questions C/C++ programmers might have about Rust. So I dusted off my copy of &#x22;The C programming language&#x22; and started to learn again.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This time it will be especially fun as my son - who has been a professional programmer for more than 6 years now - decided to get a degree in Computer Sciences so he is also taking classes about C.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The way I learn is by trying to implement things and trying to explain them. So I am going to post about my new journey with C on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://c.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;C Maven&#x3C;/a&#x3E; web site. You have been warned.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news we are celebrating Purim this week, when everyone dresses up as someone else. I wonder if I should dress up as a C programmer?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
