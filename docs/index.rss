<title>#694 - LPW: Past, Present &#x26; Future</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/694.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It has been two weeks since the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, and we are still receiving attendee reports. Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their experiences. Last week, I came across two such reports by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leejo.github.io/2024/11/07/smashed_tvs&#x22;&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2024/11/08/how-i-spent-my-first-london-perl-workshop&#x22;&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m still hoping to find a moment to reflect on my own workshop experience.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first workshop where I gave my first talk ever. I was introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by a colleague at work. Back then, there was always an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;O&#x27;Reilly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stall outside the theater room, selling &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books and surrounded by a large crowd. I remember the days when we had three strong tracks running simultaneously and, especially, the last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; organized by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Keating&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and his team. The transition was seamless, and we continued the workshop smoothly until &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID-19&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; struck. For a brief period, I was part of the organizing team, but my contributions were limited to promoting the event and assisting attendees on the day.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Bringing the workshop back after &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID-19&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was the brainchild of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Their hard work truly paid off, as the event was well-attended and praised for its smooth execution. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organizing team for providing a platform to reconnect with friends from around the world. The future of LPW looks bright as I&#x2019;m hearing a lot of positive feedback about next year&#x2019;s workshop, and I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#693 - Advertising Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/693.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Throughout the years I had many brilliant ideas regarding Perl and the Perl community. I know they were brilliant because, as I found out later, they were already done by Dave Cross before me. This always gave me mixed feelings. On one hand it was always rather disappointing that my ideas weren&#x27;t new or original. On the other hand it was of a great pride that my ideas aren&#x27;t that dumb if Dave also had them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today I think I can celebrate. I think this is the first time where I had the idea (and the implementation) first.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a recent article Dave writes about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2024/11/advertising-perl/&#x22;&#x3E;Advertising Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. A very good idea to use the existing platforms to advertise Perl events. As I can see it is exactly 10 years after I announced &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/11/shutting-down-the-perl-community-adserver.html&#x22;&#x3E;shutting down the Perl Community Adserver&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Wow, I am rather shocked that so many years have passed and unfortunately I can&#x27;t find the posts in which I started to talk about it so I can&#x27;t really verify the timeline.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case, I hope his attempt will be more successful than mine was.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#692 - LPW 2024: Quick Report</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/692.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; finally happened last Saturday 26th October. It was a pleasant morning to start the day. I happened to arrive a bit early at the venue and met &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as he was going through the slides of his upcoming talks. It was nice to have a one-on-one conversation with him. For the first time in many years of attending &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I finally mustered the courage to break the ice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Soon we all gathered in the main hall for the welcome presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I stayed in the same room for the most anticipated talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2030&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As expected it was an engaging presentation about the future of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This was followed by another interesting talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907&#x22;&#x3E;Cloudy Perl, how it looks now&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Lambley&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We took a break from technical talks for a quick presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Stuart Mackintosh&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; who shared how &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is working towards the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I had the honour of speaking to him afterward, thanking him for all the work &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is doing to bring the language back on track.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately I missed the talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7889&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Diver&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it clashed with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; presentation. I am hoping to watch the video when it becomes available. I met so many friends after a long time, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I missed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; very much but I was pleasantly surprised to meet &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Cochrane&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We spent quality time together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After lunch, it was my turn present, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It was well attended, and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made it even more special by sitting in the front row. I mostly stayed in the main hall for the rest of the talks and look forward to the recordings being available soon.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had planned to attend the post workshop social but decided to skip it at the last minute as I wasn&#x27;t feeling well. I am sure those who attended had a great time. I hope to see you all again around this time next year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least I would like to encourage you to submit your proposal for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can find more information &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please take extra care of yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#691 - Promoting Perl the right way and the wrong way</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/691.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once in a while someone suggests a way to make Perl more popular or at least to be seen by the general population of the hi-tech world.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For example, in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g6tv9r/the_uri_module_went_on_holiday_but_then_returned/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; brian d foy and others suggested people could take a bit more active role by reacting to Perl-related projects on GitHub and elsewhere. If you are ready to spend a few minutes on it, you could go to the GitHub repository of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the CPAN libraries you use and you could add a star to each one them. This is a rather small task. It won&#x27;t have a huge impact either, but many small things add up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you wonder how to find the GitHub repository of the modules you use? They are usually listed on the left-hand-side of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of each module. See for example the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/URI&#x22;&#x3E;URI&#x3C;/a&#x3E; distribution.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some modules don&#x27;t have the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link. One of the goals of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project is to encourage people to add this information to their projects. You could help with that too so it will be easier for the next person to find the repository.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last week we also saw another way someone thought to promote Perl. You can read about the Unsolicited Email many of us received in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g4bnx0/unsolicited_email_from_science_perl_committee/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I personally received 5 copies directly. I replied to them asking why do they spam me, but have not received any reply yet. This is absolutely NOT the way to promote Perl or some Perl related event or content.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lastly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is just a few days from now with lots of content and with social gatherings before and after!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week and enjoy LPW!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Hacking everyone !!!&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I hope you are busy contributing during this year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We are half way through already but still plenty of time left to kickstart if not done already.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about LPW 2024?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well it is less than &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 weeks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; before the much awaited &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; begins the fun. I am very happy to see the support of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; community in general. It is great to see regular names in the list of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html&#x22;&#x3E;sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, specially my current employer &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gold sponsor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, for all the hardwork, managing the event so smoothly so far. I am confident it would be a memorable event for everyone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Those who are planning to attend the event, there would be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7916&#x22;&#x3E;Pre Workshop Social&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7917&#x22;&#x3E;Post Workshop Social&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Please register your details asap. I have once attended pre workshop social in the past as the usual venue is not my favourite spot. Having said, I am planning to break the tradition this year and planning to attend post social workshop. How can I miss the opportunity to meet my techie friends.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you seen the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/favtalks&#x22;&#x3E;favourite talks&#x3C;/a&#x3E; list?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am personally looking forward to attend the talks e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2030&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907&#x22;&#x3E;Cloudy Perl, how it looks now&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7899&#x22;&#x3E;A modern introduction to XS&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Also my own talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am happy to see some familiar names shown interest in my talk. I can&#x27;t wait to present my talk.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am also looking forward to meet some of my techie friends after a long time. Recently I found out one coming all the way from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am wondering if anyone coming from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Japan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In the past, we always had speaker from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Japan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope to see the familiar face this time too. Anyone from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Germany&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? We will all find out first thing at the registration desk on the day.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;October&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; arrived, it also brought the dull weather with it. I don&#x27;t have good memory about it. I hope it passes without creating any havoc. You take extra care of your health, specially mental and enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;d like to thank everyone who thought about us in the past year and offered their support! It was a difficult period of time and we still can&#x27;t see the light at the end of the tunel.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A belated happy birthday to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Larry Wall&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who turned &#x3C;strong&#x3E;70&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Friday, 27th September&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Opensource contributions season is about to start with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://hacktoberfest.com&#x22;&#x3E;Hacktoberfest&#x3C;/a&#x3E; tomorrow. It would continue the whole month, enough time for you to contribute to opensource projects. Although I have registered to be part of this year event but I doubt to have time for contribution unfortunately.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I am looking forward to the most awaited event, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is happening after a long gap of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are planning to attend the event then I would suggest you register your details as it would help the organiser to manage the event smoothly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conference&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; that I completely missed and it was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl-conf.ru/24&#x22;&#x3E;Perl-Conf.Ru&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The first Perl developers conference in &#x3C;srong&#x3E;Russia&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;four years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#687 - On secrets</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/687.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-287/&#x22;&#x3E;strong passwords&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. This made me wonder &#x3C;b&#x3E;what is a strong password&#x3C;/b&#x3E;? On some web sites the length of you password is limited. (e.g. max 8 characters) which seems to me an indication that the developers have no clue about password security. Actually worse than that. It makes me worry that the site keeps the password as clear text in the database and the field size was set to that number. (e.g. 8 characters). Some places don&#x27;t allow you to include spaces which make me wonder if they are constructing their database INSERT statement using string concatenation opening themselves to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://bobby-tables.com/&#x22;&#x3E;SQL injection attacks&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On many web sites you are required to use both upper and lowercase letters, digits and symbols. The symbols being a subset of the characters having the decimal ASCII code 32-47, 58-64, 91-96, 126. That is up to 30 different characters. The letters are 2*26 characters and the digits are the 10 different digits. The number of possibilities using letters and digits only is (26*2 + 10)^n  and if we include all the symbols as well then it is (26*2 + 10 + 30)^n for a password of n characters. If I am not mistaken with this and with the calculations, this means that a 7-character password using [a-zA-Z0-9] has more variety than a 6-character password that also includes symbols. In other words having a longer password makes your password much stronger than including symbols as well.  As far as I understand having 15-charcter password using only letters and spaces would make my password much stronger than having an 8-character password using all 92 characters.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I tend to use sentences that make sense to me or quotes from poems or from song lyrics as passwords. That makes it much easier to remember them and - if I am not mistaken - harder to find by an attacker.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What do you think?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news Adam Russell, Brett Estrade, and Christos Argyropoulos are trying to get the word out about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/09/perl-community-conference-science-perl-journal-winter-2024-call-for-papers-now-open-deadline-930.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community Conference / Science Perl Journal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Winter 2024 CALL FOR PAPERS NOW OPEN!

<title>#686 - Perl Conference</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/686.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about conference, I would like to share a big announcement about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/dates_set_tprc_2025&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2025&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It was a big surprise for me. I hope and wish this time, it would be a big crowd puller for both &#x3C;strong&#x3E;attendees&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;sponsors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We even have the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/2024tprc&#x22;&#x3E;action report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRC 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as shared by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Plenty of interesting results came out of it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, if we are talking conference then how can we miss the long awaiting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is going strong as we are approaching the event. A gentle reminder to myself to get my slides ready for my talk. I am super excited to meet my heroes in person.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, you please take care of your health. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x27;t have much to say today and frankly I am rather tired of all kinds of things not related to Perl or programming. Just looking at the news and its reflection on social media makes me extremly sad.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, you could check out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/09/london-perl-raku-workshop-2024-schedule-now-available.html&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024 Schedule&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
