<title>#725 - Perl podcasts?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/725.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First of all, I&#x27;d like to apologize, I could not get back to every reader of the Perl Weekly who expressed their solidarity and asked if I am in any danger: My immediate family and myself, are OK, but it is scary to be targetted by half-a-ton ballistic missiles.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A funny thing happened, someone, called SophoDave, asked if there are any &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1lah0a7/perl_podcasts/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl podcasts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; just when the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://underbar.cpan.io/episodes/2/&#x22;&#x3E;2nd episode of The Underbar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was published. One person recommended our newsletter to which Olaf Alders suggested someone could read it out aloud.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dave Cross wrote about a Perl script &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2025/06/generating-content-with-chatgpt/&#x22;&#x3E;Generating Content with ChatGPT&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Which made me wonder, would it be possible to have some Perl script that would take the content of the Perl Weekly newsletter and using some AI tool would generated a podcast out of it? Any volunteers?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish you a calm week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#724 - Perl and XS</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/724.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What&#x27;s &#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;XS (eXternal Subroutine)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is a glue language that helps &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; interact with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;C&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sounds simple?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In my personal experience, it&#x27;s not simple at all. I&#x27;ve tried many times but never managed to fully grasp it. Recently, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, shared a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-xs-how-to-create-an-object-24lj&#x22;&#x3E;blog post series&#x3C;/a&#x3E; titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Learning XS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which I found very helpful in unraveling its complexity.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Robert Acock&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; also wrote another blog series for newcomers: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/lnation/learning-perl-introduction-3d1a&#x22;&#x3E;Learning Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m sure this would be handy for anyone looking to explore &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lately, I&#x27;ve been playing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AWS S3&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and have shared my experiences in two posts so far:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/localstack-aws-s3&#x22;&#x3E;LocalStack with AWS S3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/aws-s3-encryption&#x22;&#x3E;AWS S3 Encryption&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are plenty more articles in the pipeline, so watch this space!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#723 - Perl Ad Server needs ads</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/723.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am glad that the renewed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1kxbuw2/perl_ad_server_needs_ads/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Ad Server&#x3C;/a&#x3E; seems to be taking off. If you have some Perl-related thing you&#x27;d like to promote to MetaCPAN and other sites displaying the ads, this is your chance to add it to inventory of ads.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you have a Perl-related event that you&#x27;d like to be listed at the bottom of each edition of the Perl Weekly newsletter and included in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, you can do that by sending a Pull-Request.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;d also like to thank all the people who started to support me via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I feel happy that there are people out there who find my contribution valuable to award it with their financial support. I&#x27;d also like to thank the people who decided to support my by buying one of my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;books and courses&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#722 - MetaCPAN and Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/722.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Remember &#x3C;strong&#x3E;search.cpan.org&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was my go to page for finding &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; distributions until &#x3C;strong&#x3E;June, 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, when the service was unfortunately shut down. That&#x27;s when I switched to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Over time, I&#x27;ve come to truly appreciate its power, thanks to the dedicated team of volunteers working tirelessly to keep it running smoothly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Honestly, I never realised how much effort and time went into maintaining such a vast repository of informations, until I spent a few days with the core team at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I have immense respect for their work. It&#x27;s disheartening to hear complaints when the service is slow or down. Instead of criticising, I wish more people would step up to help. That way, they&#x27;d gain a deeper appreciation for what it takes to keep &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; alive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of community efforts, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made a public call for help to upgrade &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E; from an older version of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1kufqfj/how_is_your_hugo&#x22;&#x3E;(see reddit post here)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Incredibly, there&#x27;s already a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/perldotcom/pull/446&#x22;&#x3E;pull request&#x3C;/a&#x3E; waiting for review, what a turnaround.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I just realised that I&#x27;ve completed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;seven years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as co-editor of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Weekly Newsletter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I joined the team back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May, 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Time flies, incredible!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is bank holiday in England, so I&#x27;m taking it easy. Enjoy the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#721 - Perl Roadmap</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/721.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I asked &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/594&#x22;&#x3E;How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I received quite a few nice comments. Thank you! I&#x27;ll have another question today.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday I asked in a Web 3 group how to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://web3.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;get started with Web3, Blockchain, cryptocurrency, Ethereum&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.... I got a few suggestions including a link to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/blockchain&#x22;&#x3E;Blockchain Roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. So I checked. There is also a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/python&#x22;&#x3E;Python Roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://roadmap.sh/rust&#x22;&#x3E;Rust roadmap&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but I have not found a &#x3C;b&#x3E;Perl Roadmap&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. Not even a community created one. IMHO, if you are interested in making Perl easier to learn, more available and hopefully more popular than you might want to invest some time to create a community roadmap for Perl and maybe even to get it listed as an official roadmap.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Which brings me to my question this week &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/601&#x22;&#x3E;What could be done to make Perl more popular?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;d appreciate your comments there.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a totally different subject. I think this might be a good time to mention that if you find my work valuable to you, I&#x27;d appreciate if you could also express it by sponsoring me. GitHub provides a way to make it very easy to give 5-10-20 USD / month to express your gratitude and help me invest more time in the public work. Go to my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub sponsors page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and sign up to sponsor me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#720 - GPW 2025</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/720.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today marks the start of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, taking place in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Munich&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;May 12-14, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This three-day event promises to be packed with insightful sessions. You can checkout the schedules for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-12&#x22;&#x3E;Day 1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-13&#x22;&#x3E;Day 2&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/schedule?day=2025-05-14&#x22;&#x3E;Day 3&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed several familiar names from the recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, including &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Salve J. Nilsen&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ference Erki&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There are also regular attendees like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Overmeer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Nicholas Clark&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Max Maischein&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Renee Backer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Soren Laird Sorries&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. However, one notable absence is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thomas Klausner&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Looking at the schedule, it&#x27;s shaping up to be a highly impactful event. And yes, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;R Geoffrey Avery&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the Gong man, is also listed as the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lightning Talks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; manager.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As many of you know the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, wrapped up just a week ago and we&#x27;ve already seen plenty of event reports from the participants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This was my first time attending the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, and I&#x27;m grateful to the organisers for the opportunity. While I&#x27;ve been to many &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conferences&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was a completely different experience altogether. The setting allowed for more frequent interaction with attendees, making it easier to seek (and receive) instant help. The knowledge sharing was at its peak, especially with people like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the room. Some participants like &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leo Lapworth&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; joined remotely via video conference.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wasn&#x27;t fully prepared as my invitation came at the last minute. In contrast, most attendees had everything well planned. I observed structured groups focusing on specific tasks e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Security&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was free to join any. I chose &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; both because it&#x27;s close to my heart and because of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Admittedly, I didn&#x27;t have my laptop set up for contributions initially. But thanks to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PTS&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; environment, I had a working local &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; web instance, in no time. You can read more about my experience in my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/pts-2025&#x22;&#x3E;detailed event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Other attendees like &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-participation-to-the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025-41j2&#x22;&#x3E;Thibault Duponchelle&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2025/05/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025.html&#x22;&#x3E;Paul Johnson&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlpunk.github.io/posts/2025-05-the-annual-perl-toolchain-summit-2025&#x22;&#x3E;Tina Muller&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2025/05/a-different-perl-toolchain-summit.html&#x22;&#x3E;Leon Timmermans&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, also shared their insights.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#719 - How do you deal with the decline?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/719.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is no secret that there are less and less jobs that are for &#x27;Perl developers&#x27;. I still see many &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=perl&#x22;&#x3E;job posts that mention Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but those are mostly cases where Perl is just one of the items in a large toolbox. In many cases you can still use Perl as a tool. There is less and less demand for perl application developers. There is 0 demand for teaching Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I encountered this many years ago and first learned &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Python and now Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E; because that&#x27;s what my clients ask for. How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs? I&#x27;d love to get your feedback and for that I open an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/594&#x22;&#x3E;issue&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in the GitHub repository of the Perl Weekly. I&#x27;d love to read what you do!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Perl-related events:&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the bottom of each issue we include a list of Perl-related events. They can also be seen on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and you can even use our ical file to see the events in your calendar application.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This information is collected in a JSON file in our repository. The file is linked at the top of that page. If you organize a Perl-related event or if you know about one that is not listed there, send us a Pull-Request and we can include it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/718.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please accept my apology for sharing a crypto scam link in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;716th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the newsletter. Thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it was removed straight away. I will be more cautious from now onwards, promise.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently, I stumbled upon a post titled &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Top 11 Perl Services Companies in the World in 2025&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Sadly, not a single one is based in my city &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was a time, we had plenty! Still, it&#x27;s not all bad. I was thrilled to see &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ActiveState&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on the list, the company behind &#x3C;strong&#x3E;ActiveState Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/716.html&#x22;&#x3E;earlier edition of the newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I mentioned my wish to attend the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; which is an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;invite-only&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; annual event. I also shared my interest in contributing to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; project. To my absolute delight, that wish came true the very same day! I received an invitation from the organiser to join the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, happening in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leipzig, Germany&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from May 1st to May 4th 2025. I didn&#x27;t wait even a second to accept the invitation. It&#x27;s truly an honour to be part of such a talented group.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In all the excitement, I&#x27;ve already booked my flight ticket to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Berlin&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and from there I&#x27;ll hop on a fast train to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Leipzig&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The last time, I visited Germany was back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; when I attended the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the city of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gummersbach&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I even gave couple of talks and one of them being &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Introduction to Map::Tube&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. After the event, I even shared my experience in this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#717 - Happy Easter</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/717.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First of all I need to apologize. Last week we mistakenly included a link to a crypto scam. Clearly we have to be more careful with our inclusion policy. Thanks to the Pull-Request of Dave Cross the link was removed from our web site within a few hours. The strange thing is that the post is still up on Medium. I would have thought they would want to avoid having scams on their website.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week Mohammad wrote that he keeps planning to be involved in the MetaCPAN project. As far as I remember it has two major part written in Perl. The back-end is indeed hard to setup, but I think the front-end is quite easy and that part is also written in Perl. I have a bunch of posts, some of them videos about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/metacpan&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, including direction, how to contribute to it. I think it is also a very good feeling once your contribution is accepted and it goes live on the site. Besides, you get on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/about/contributors&#x22;&#x3E;list of contributors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#716 - CVE in Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/716.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A few days ago, I wrote a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/cve-in-perl&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVEs&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was my first time looking at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVEs&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; closely. Then I came across a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1jy9pbe/perl_5402_and_5384_released_with_cve_fix&#x22;&#x3E;reddit post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; discussing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CVE-2024-56406&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am a bit confused, was this fixed in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/5.38.4/perldelta&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.38.4&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5402delta&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.40.2&#x3C;/a&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;That said, it gave me something fun to dig into. I already know what I&#x27;ll be doing next. During my search, I discovered the, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://security.metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Security Group&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a community effort dedicated to handling security incidents on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Pretty cool!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Also the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; needs our support as mentioned in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2025-needs-you&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m happy to see my current employer, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, listed as one of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;In-Kind Sponsors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Now, I&#x27;m curious to find out who the lucky team member is that gets to attend!. It&#x27;s happening this year from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thursday May 1st&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sunday May 4th 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember back in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the summit was held so close to me, in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Marlow&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, if I recall correctly. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again, I have to get involved in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; project. The main blocker last time was setting up the local development environment. I spoke to someone about it, can&#x27;t remember who, and he mentioned the team was working on simplifying the setup process to make it easier for contributors. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check the current status, but I&#x27;m adding it to my ever-growing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TODO&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; list.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Monday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and enjoy the rest of the newsletter!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
